ViDeck keymap for ErgoDox
=========================

This is a QWERTY layout based on the US layout, where Vi functionality has been
especially considered.

# Features
* Mouse movements using the Vi movement keys.
* Vi movement keys doubling as arrow keys.
* Mimicking the readline commands ^A and ^E to generate Home and End.
* Mimicking the Vim commands ^F and ^B to generate Page Down and Page Up.
* Double tapping shift key generates Caps Lock.
* Acess to the escape key using left thumb.
* Reasonably accessible Scroll Lock key (useful if you, like me, want to switch
  to a non-US layout once in a while in X).
* Dead, unused keys where the fingers have a hard time reaching. Keeps me from
  accidentaly hitting the wrong key.

# Missing keys
* Pause/Break.
* Print Screen.
* Right Alt.
* Right Ctrl.

# LEDs
* Caps Lock is indicated using first LED.
* Arrow keys layer is indicated using second LED.
* Mouse keys layer is indicated using third LED.
